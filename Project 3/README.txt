Please note that I have run this program using python3 exclusively on a Windows
operating system.

To run this program through the Windows command prompt
1. open the terminal
2. navigate (using cd) to the directory where the program is stored
3. type the name of the program "p3.py" and hit enter

To run this program using IDLE interface
1. open file explorer
2. navigate to the directory where the program is stored
3. right click the file and select "edit with IDLE"
4. in IDLE, click run in the toolbar and then click run module

While running the program
1. You will be prompted to enter the name of a file containing a knapsack
	ex: "input-1.txt"
2. The program will then run the three algorithms and print its findings
3. You will be prompted to enter whether or not to continue testing files
	a. To continue testing additonal files enter "1"
	b. To end the program enter "0"

Please Note: I have included 4 tester files in this project.
input-1.txt was provided to the whole class
input-2.txt was an example that we solved by hand in class
input-3.txt and input-4.txt are tests that I came up with on my own
